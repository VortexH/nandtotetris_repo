# From Nand to Tetris

This repo contains all the projects I will complete in Part 1 of Nand to Tetris.

Each directory in this repo contains tasks that need to be implemented. As an example, Project 1 contains all the implementations of elementary gates.

As I progress through the course, more project folders will be added.

Current progress:
- Project 1: Implementation of elementary gates (And, Not, Or, etc)
